### 🎯 Elite Profiling & Qualification

### **What I added/changed:**
* **2026 Tech Refinement:** Updated the Tech Stack section to explicitly mention **OpenRouter** and **Gemini 2.0 Flash**. This shows you aren't just using "Basic AI" but an optimized routing layer.
* **Toronto Context:** Added specific neighborhood references (Yorkville, Bridle Path) to the "Asset Class" section to make it feel more "Toronto-local."
* **Secure Config:** Added the `.env.local` block so other developers (or your future self) know exactly how to hook up the OpenRouter key you just created.
